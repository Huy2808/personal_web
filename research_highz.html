                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>The history of the Universe is characterized by distinct epochs of structure assembly and formation. Among these, there is a critical period known as the Cosmic Dawn, which marks the time when the first stars and galaxies began to form.
                            This ended the Dark Ages and initiated the Epoch of Reionization, fundamentally transforming the intergalactic medium from neutral to ionized. This is one of the last major phase transitions in the Universe and is suggested that it was
                            largely complete by redshift z ~ 6, which is about 1 billion years after the Big Bang. Therefore, galaxies at these redshifts
                            therefore provide a crucial window into this transitionary era, lying at the boundary between
                            a partially ionized and a fully ionized Universe. 
                        </p>


                        <p>In this project, we focus on P109 (also called RXC J2248-ID3), a quintuply lensed galaxy located at redshift z ~ 6.11, distorted and magnified by the Abell S1063 galaxy cluster. Over the years, P109 has been observed with several major 
                            facilities, including the VLT, Magellan/FIRE, HST, and more recently JWST, providing high-quality imaging and spectroscopy from the ultraviolet to the infrared. With the unprecedented spatial resolution of JWST, we were able to distinguish the individual 
                        substructures within the galaxy and study their properties in detail.</p>

                            <p>From the multiband images and source plane reconstruction, we confirmed that P109 has a 3 distinct clumps of star-forming regions as shown in Figure 1. 
                                The presence of such compact clumps is consistent with the theoretical predictions of of the violent disk instability model for the high-redshift galaxies, where gas-rich turbulent 
                                disks fragment into massive star-forming clumps due to gravitational instabilities. We then use spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to derive the physical properties for each 
                                clump and galaxy as a whole, including their stellar masses, star formation rates, ages, and dust content. We then compare P109 properties to the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) 
                                at similar redshifts to understand its star formation activity in the context of galaxy evolution as shown in Figure 2.

                            the ±0.34 dex scatter (± 1-σ). P109 from our study is shown as a red square, along with its three clumps:
                            Clump 1 (yellow square), Clump 2 (green square), and Clump 3 (black square). For comparison, the result
                            for P109 from Topping et al. (2024) is also plotted as an orange circle.</figcaption>

                               <p>From the Figure 2, P109 is firmly in the starburst regime, indicating
                                an exceptionally high star formation efficiency. This extreme activity is likely captured in
                                our model by the recent burst component, which dominates the galaxy’s UV luminosity. While Clump 1 and Clump 2 are powerful starbursts lying above or on the MS, Clump 3 falls on
                                it. Its low and poorly constrained SFR suggests that its star formation has significantly
                                declined compared to the other two clumps.</p> 

                                <p> Our results show that significant internal diversity can exist even within small,
                                    high-redshift systems, with regions of extreme star formation coexisting alongside less active
                                    components.Future observations with integral field spectroscopy could provide the kinematic data
                                    needed to confirm the association of these clumps and further unravel the assembly history
                                    of this intriguing system.</p>
