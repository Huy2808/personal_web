                        <h2>Galactic structure</h2>
                        <p> The galaxy is divided into several components that we can identify by their evolution and kinematics properties and chemical composition.
                        We will focus on the Milky Way, which is a barred spiral galaxy, but this argument only apply to systems in the <b>local universe</b>. 
                        The <b>local universe</b> is the region of space about 1 Byr from Earth that every stellar system in which, with the current observational facilities, we can identify stars.</p>

                        <p>The most important component of the local universe is called <b>local group</b>, which are all the stellar system within a distance $d \leq 1\mathrm{Mpc}$.
                        This regions is dominated by the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. The other crucial component of the local universe is the <b>local volume</b>, which is the 
                        system within 25 Mpc.</p> 

                        <p> The local universe is affected by the local motion and it is moving towards the <b>Great Attractor</b>. This is important if we want to measure the Hubble constant $H_0$ 
                            since the local motion can affect the redshift of the galaxies. Furthermore, there are no elliptical galaxies in the local group.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <p>When studying our galaxy, the important components that needed to investigate are halo, bulge, and disk.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Halo:</strong> Spherical region surrounding the galaxy (<span style="color: rgb(163, 148, 250);">$M_{halo} \approx 0.1 M_{MW}$, $R_{halo} \approx 120 \mathrm{kpc}$</span>), containing mainly old red stars and globular clusters. 
                                Low metallicity, indicating early formation. Globular clusters are stellar systems with <span style="color: rgb(163, 148, 250);"> $M_{GC} \approx 10^3 - 10^6 M_{\odot}$</span> and almost the age of the universe. The stars within 
                                them follow the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution due to their radial velocity. <span style="color: rgb(238, 144, 144);">These structures are the most important stellar systems you can find in the halo.</span></li>
                            <li><strong>Bulge:</strong> Central, dense region of the galaxy (<span style="color: rgb(163, 148, 250);">$M_{bulge} \approx 0.4 M_{MW}$, $R_{bulge} \approx 3 \mathrm{kpc}$</span>). Contains mostly red stars and have similar stellar population as the halo</li>
                            <li><strong>Disk:</strong> Flat, rotating component containing most of the galaxy's stars, gas, and dust (<span style="color: rgb(163, 148, 250);">$M_{disk} \approx 0.5 M_{MW}$, $R_{disk} \approx 20 - 23 \mathrm{kpc}$</span>). Includes spiral arms with ongoing star formation. 
                                Contain open clusters (younger and more chaotic than globular clusters) with the main population beging blue stars.</li>
                        </ul> 
                         
                        In astrophysics, we can only measure radiation in specific bands rather than the whole spectrum. Therefore, we use the <b>Photometric System</b> as shown in Figure 2.
                        <figure class="note-figure float-right">
                            <img src="image/photometric_system.png" alt="Photometric System Diagram" width="300px" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
                            <figcaption style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;">Figure 2: Common photometric systems used in astronomy, showing filters (U, B, G, V, R, IR) and their wavelength coverage.</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        An important thing that we can use to characterize stellar popolation is their chemical composition, such as their <b>metallicity</b> [Fe/H] = log<sub>10</sub>(Z/Z<sub>☉</sub>), where Z is the metallicity and Z<sub>☉</sub> is the solar metallicity. 
                        For halo population, we have -3.5$\leq$[Fe/H]$\leq$-1.5, for disk population, we have -1.0$\leq$[Fe/H]$\leq$0.5, and for bulge population, we have -1.5$\leq$[Fe/H]$\leq$0.5. This indicate that metallicity is not a good indicator for the age of a star.

                        <p> The <b><span style="color: rgb(163, 148, 250);">distance modulus</span></b> is the apparent distance between the absolute and apparent magnitude <span style="color: rgb(163, 148, 250);">$DM_{\nu} = m_{\nu} - M_{\nu} = 5(\log_{10}(D) - 1)$</span>, where D is the distance in parsecs.</p>
                        <p> However, we need to account for the amount of dust between us and the object also, which is called <b><span style="color: rgb(163, 148, 250);">color excess E(B - V) = $A_B - A_V$</span></b></p>. Therefore, the intrinsic color is 
                        $$(m_B - m_V)_{\phi} = (m_B - m_V) - E(B - V)$$ 


                        <figure class="note-figure float-left">
                            <img src="image/reddening_law.png" alt="Reddening Law Diagram" width="400px" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
                            <figcaption style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;">Figure 3: Reddening law in astronomy, showing the relationship between extinction and frequency. J, H, K are belongs to the near-infrared photometric system.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Starting from the distance modulus, we can express that $A_V = R_V . E(B-V)$, with $R_V$ being the total-to-selective absorption ratio. Usually, $R_V \approx 3.1$. However, this only works on V band, therefore, we need some extra information to work 
                            with other bands, which is called the <b>reddening law</b>. However, the first principle of the reddening law comes from the empirical evidences rather than derivation. The evidences said that a good fraction for the a galaxy is about 3.1
                        Looking at the Figure 3, we can see that the shorter wavelength are observed less is because their wave-lengths are comparable to the dust grains, therefore, they are more affected by extinction. For example, the transition from the optical to near-ir is 
                        $\dfrac{A_U}{A_V} \approx 1.6$, which means that the number of photons in U band is 16 times dimmer than in V band.</p>

                        <p>The peak in the Figure 3 is called the <b>Druid Profile</b> and it is associated with the size of the grains that are absorbing the photons. The main culprit seems to be PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons).</p>

                        <h2>Stellar Matter</h2> 

                        <p>The ingredients of a star are gas and radiation. We need to quantify the properties of the material. The first step is to use the <b>Mean Molecular Weight</b>:
                        $$\mu = \dfrac{\langle m \rangle}{m_H} = \dfrac{\rho}{n m_H}$$
                        where $\langle m \rangle$ is the average mass of a particle, $m_H$ is the mass of hydrogen, $\rho$ is the density of the gas, and n is the number of particles per unit volume.</p>

                        <p>For a fully ionized gas, we have 3 parameters, which are $X_i, \, A_i, \, Z_i$, which are the mass fraction, atomic weight, and atomic number, respectively. Therefore, the total number of particles per unit volume is given by
                            $$n = \sum_i \dfrac{\rho X_i}{A_i m_H} + \sum_i \dfrac{\rho X_i Z_i}{A_i m_H}$$
                            where the first term is the contribution from the ions and the second one is the contribution of electrons. Therefore, we can express the mean molecular weight as
                            $$\mu = \dfrac{1}{\sum_i \dfrac{X_i}{A_i}}$$
                        </p>
                        <div style="clear: both;"></div>
                        
                        <h2>Stellar Structure and Evolution</h2>
                        
                        <h3>Equations of Stellar Structure</h3>
                        <p> To derive the equations of stellar structure, we need to make a few assumptions:</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>1. Spherical symmetry:</strong> </p>
                        The star is assumed to be spherically symmetric, 
                        meaning that all properties depend only on the radial distance from the center. 
                        We can neglect the magnetic field, rotation and meridian circulations.
                    
                        <p><strong>2. Hydrostatic equilibrium:</strong></p>
                        The pressure has to balance the gravity and steadily increase throughout the stars layers.
                        $$\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{GM_r \rho}{r^2}$$
                        
                        <p><strong>3. Energy transport:</strong></p>
                        Flux carriers in the interiors are radiation, convection and conduction. The only physical mechanism that mix stellar interiors is convection.
                        $$\frac{dL_r}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho \epsilon$$
                        
                        <p><strong>4. Diffusion approximation:</strong></p>
                        We neglect the dependency and we use the mean over the sum of all frequencies.
                        This only apply to stellar interior since almost all elements are fully ionized. 
                        Atomic diffusion and change in chemical composition are also negelected.
                        
                        <br><br>

                        <p>We have empirical evidence that star are not affected by rapid changes. In hydrostatic equilibrium, the gravity and pressure has to be balanced: 
                        We can express this as:<p>
                        \begin{equation} 
                        \begin{aligned} 
                        &F_p = F_G\\
                        \Leftrightarrow ~&(P(r + dr) - P(r))dS = -\dfrac{GM}{r^2}dm\\
                        \Leftrightarrow ~&\dfrac{dP}{dr}~ dr~ dS = -\dfrac{GM}{r^2}\rho~ dS~ dr \\
                        \Leftrightarrow ~&\dfrac{dP}{dr} = -\dfrac{GM}{r^2}\rho \\
                        \Leftrightarrow ~&\boxed{\dfrac{dP}{dr} = -g\rho}

                        \end{aligned}
                        \end{equation} 
                        This is the <strong>momentum conservation equation.</strong>
                        <br>

                        <strong>Mass conservation equation</strong> can be expresses as:

                        $$\boxed{\dfrac{dM}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho}$$ 

                        Now we have three unknowns (P, M, $\rho$), and two differential equations. 
                        For thiss, we need to have another equation, which is the equation of state P = P ($\rho$, T).
                        Since T is another unknown, we now need to have another equation for $\dfrac{dT}{dr}$ (radiative transfer equation).

                        <br>
                        The pressure in a star is given by the sum of gas pressure and radiation pressure:
                        $$P = P_{gas} + P_{rad}$$ 
                        where $P_{rad} = \dfrac{aT^4}{3}$, "a" here is the radiation density constant.

                        From statistical mechanics, we have that: 
                        $$P_{gas} = \dfrac{1}{3} \sum_i m_i v_i^2 = \dfrac{2}{3}W_i$$
                        where $W_i$ is the kinetic energy density. We also have that the kinetic energy for a monatomic molecule is: 
                        $$E_k = \dfrac{3}{2} K_B T$$ 
                        
                        Therefore, we can express the gas pressure as: 
                        $$P_{gas} = \dfrac{2}{3}~\dfrac{3}{2}~n K_B T = \dfrac{\rho}{\mu m_H} K_B T = \dfrac{K_B T \rho}{\mu m_H}$$
                        where n is the number of particles per unit volume. 
                        
                        Finally, we can express the total pressure as:
                        $$\boxed{P = \dfrac{K_B T \rho}{\mu m_H} + \dfrac{aT^4}{3}}$$
                        
                        <br> 
                        We can introduce another equation, which is the <strong>radiative transfer equation</strong>:
                        $$\boxed{\dfrac{dT}{dr} = -\dfrac{3\kappa\rho}{4act^3}(\phi_rad + \phi_{cond})}$$
                        where $\kappa$ is the opacity, $\phi_{rad}$ is the radiative flux, and $\phi_{cond}$ is the conductive flux.
                        <br>
                        However, from Stefan-Boltzmann law, we have that:
                        $$L = 4\pi r^2 \sigma T^4 = 4\pi r^2 \phi$$ 
                        therefore, we have to introduce another unknown, which is L. To deal with this, we use the <strong>energy conservation equation</strong>:
                        $$\boxed{\dfrac{dL}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho \epsilon}$$
                        where $\epsilon$ is the <strong>energy generation rate per unit time</strong>, $\epsilon = \epsilon_g + \epsilon_N + \epsilon_{\nu}$.

                        <br>
                        Since the time scale for chemical composition to change is much larger, we can neglect it!

                        <br> <br> 
                        
                        Another important point is the radius 'r' is not suitable as an independent variable sicne it's not able to follow the changes of the star. 
                        The mass 'M' is better since it behaves Langragianly. Therefore, we can rewrite the conservation equations in terms of dM by devide both sides by $\dfrac{dM}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho$.
