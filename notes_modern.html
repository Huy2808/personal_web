                        <h2>Galactic structure</h2>
                        <p> The galaxy is divided into several components that we can identify by their evolution and kinematics properties and chemical composition.
                        We will focus on the Milky Way, which is a barred spiral galaxy, but this argument only apply to systems in the <b>local universe</b>. 
                        The <b>local universe</b> is the region of space about 1 Byr from Earth that every stellar system in which, with the current observational facilities, we can identify stars.</p>

                        <p>The most important component of the local universe is called <b>local group</b>, which are all the stellar system within a distance $d \leq 1\mathrm{Mpc}$.
                        This regions is dominated by the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. The other crucial component of the local universe is the <b>local volume</b>, which is the 
                        system within 25 Mpc.</p> 

                        <p> The local universe is affected by the local motion and it is moving towards the <b>Great Attractor</b>. This is important if we want to measure the Hubble constant $H_0$ 
                            since the local motion can affect the redshift of the galaxies. Furthermore, there are no elliptical galaxies in the local group.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <p>When studying our galaxy, the important components that needed to investigate are halo, bulge, and disk.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Halo:</strong> Spherical region surrounding the galaxy (<span style="color: rgb(163, 148, 250);">$M_{halo} \approx 0.1 M_{MW}$, $R_{halo} \approx 120 \mathrm{kpc}$</span>), containing mainly old red stars and globular clusters. 
                                Low metallicity, indicating early formation. Globular clusters are stellar systems with <span style="color: rgb(163, 148, 250);"> $M_{GC} \approx 10^3 - 10^6 M_{\odot}$</span> and almost the age of the universe. The stars within 
                                them follow the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution due to their radial velocity. <span style="color: rgb(238, 144, 144);">These structures are the most important stellar systems you can find in the halo.</span></li>
                            <li><strong>Bulge:</strong> Central, dense region of the galaxy (<span style="color: rgb(163, 148, 250);">$M_{bulge} \approx 0.4 M_{MW}$, $R_{bulge} \approx 3 \mathrm{kpc}$</span>). Contains mostly red stars and have similar stellar population as the halo</li>
                            <li><strong>Disk:</strong> Flat, rotating component containing most of the galaxy's stars, gas, and dust (<span style="color: rgb(163, 148, 250);">$M_{disk} \approx 0.5 M_{MW}$, $R_{disk} \approx 20 - 23 \mathrm{kpc}$</span>). Includes spiral arms with ongoing star formation. 
                                Contain open clusters (younger and more chaotic than globular clusters) with the main population beging blue stars.</li>
                        </ul> 
                         
                        In astrophysics, we can only measure radiation in specific bands rather than the whole spectrum. Therefore, we use the <b>Photometric System</b> as shown in Figure 2.
                        <figure class="note-figure float-right">
                            <img src="image/photometric_system.png" alt="Photometric System Diagram" width="300px" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
                            <figcaption style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;">Figure 2: Common photometric systems used in astronomy, showing filters (U, B, G, V, R, IR) and their wavelength coverage.</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        An important thing that we can use to characterize stellar popolation is their chemical composition, such as their <b>metallicity</b> [Fe/H] = log<sub>10</sub>(Z/Z<sub>☉</sub>), where Z is the metallicity and Z<sub>☉</sub> is the solar metallicity. 
                        For halo population, we have -3.5$\leq$[Fe/H]$\leq$-1.5, for disk population, we have -1.0$\leq$[Fe/H]$\leq$0.5, and for bulge population, we have -1.5$\leq$[Fe/H]$\leq$0.5. This indicate that metallicity is not a good indicator for the age of a star.

                        <p> The <b><span style="color: rgb(163, 148, 250);">distance modulus</span></b> is the apparent distance between the absolute and apparent magnitude <span style="color: rgb(163, 148, 250);">$DM_{\nu} = m_{\nu} - M_{\nu} = 5(\log_{10}(D) - 1)$</span>, where D is the distance in parsecs.</p>
                        <p> However, we need to account for the amount of dust between us and the object also, which is called <b><span style="color: rgb(163, 148, 250);">color excess E(B - V) = $A_B - A_V$</span></b></p>. Therefore, the intrinsic color is 
                        $$(m_B - m_V)_{\phi} = (m_B - m_V) - E(B - V)$$ 


                        <figure class="note-figure float-left">
                            <img src="image/reddening_law.png" alt="Reddening Law Diagram" width="400px" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
                            <figcaption style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;">Figure 3: Reddening law in astronomy, showing the relationship between extinction and frequency. J, H, K are belongs to the near-infrared photometric system.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Starting from the distance modulus, we can express that $A_V = R_V . E(B-V)$, with $R_V$ being the total-to-selective absorption ratio. Usually, $R_V \approx 3.1$. However, this only works on V band, therefore, we need some extra information to work 
                            with other bands, which is called the <b>reddening law</b>. However, the first principle of the reddening law comes from the empirical evidences rather than derivation. The evidences said that a good fraction for the a galaxy is about 3.1
                        Looking at the Figure 3, we can see that the shorter wavelength are observed less is because their wave-lengths are comparable to the dust grains, therefore, they are more affected by extinction. For example, the transition from the optical to near-ir is 
                        $\dfrac{A_U}{A_V} \approx 1.6$, which means that the number of photons in U band is 16 times dimmer than in V band.</p>

                        <p>The peak in the Figure 3 is called the <b>Druid Profile</b> and it is associated with the size of the grains that are absorbing the photons. The main culprit seems to be PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons).</p>

                        <h2>Stellar Matter</h2> 

                        <p>The ingredients of a star are gas and radiation. We need to quantify the properties of the material. The first step is to use the <b>Mean Molecular Weight</b>:
                        $$\mu = \dfrac{\langle m \rangle}{m_H} = \dfrac{\rho}{n m_H}$$
                        where $\langle m \rangle$ is the average mass of a particle, $m_H$ is the mass of hydrogen, $\rho$ is the density of the gas, and n is the number of particles per unit volume.</p>

                        <p>For a fully ionized gas, we have 3 parameters, which are $X_i, \, A_i, \, Z_i$, which are the mass fraction, atomic weight, and atomic number, respectively. Therefore, the total number of particles per unit volume is given by
                            $$n = \sum_i \dfrac{\rho X_i}{A_i m_H} + \sum_i \dfrac{\rho X_i Z_i}{A_i m_H}$$
                            where the first term is the contribution from the ions and the second one is the contribution of electrons. Therefore, we can express the mean molecular weight as
                            $$\mu = \dfrac{1}{\sum_i \dfrac{X_i}{A_i}}$$
                        </p>
                        <div style="clear: both;"></div>
                        
                        <h2>Stellar Structure and Evolution</h2>
                        
                        <h3>Equations of Stellar Structure</h3>
                        <p> To derive the equations of stellar structure, we need to make a few assumptions:</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>1. Spherical symmetry:</strong> </p>
                        The star is assumed to be spherically symmetric, 
                        meaning that all properties depend only on the radial distance from the center. 
                        We can neglect the magnetic field, rotation and meridian circulations.
                    
                        <p><strong>2. Hydrostatic equilibrium:</strong></p>
                        The pressure has to balance the gravity and steadily increase throughout the stars layers.
                        $$\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{GM_r \rho}{r^2}$$
                        
                        <p><strong>3. Energy transport:</strong></p>
                        Flux carriers in the interiors are radiation, convection and conduction. The only physical mechanism that mix stellar interiors is convection.
                        $$\frac{dL_r}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho \epsilon$$
                        
                        <p><strong>4. Diffusion approximation:</strong></p>
                        We neglect the dependency and we use the mean over the sum of all frequencies.
                        This only apply to stellar interior since almost all elements are fully ionized. 
                        Atomic diffusion and change in chemical composition are also negelected.
                        
                        <br><br>

                        <p>We have empirical evidence that star are not affected by rapid changes. In hydrostatic equilibrium, the gravity and pressure has to be balanced: 
                        We can express this as:<p>
                        \begin{equation} 
                        \begin{aligned} 
                        &F_p = F_G\\
                        \Leftrightarrow ~&(P(r + dr) - P(r))dS = -\dfrac{GM}{r^2}dm\\
                        \Leftrightarrow ~&\dfrac{dP}{dr}~ dr~ dS = -\dfrac{GM}{r^2}\rho~ dS~ dr \\
                        \Leftrightarrow ~&\dfrac{dP}{dr} = -\dfrac{GM}{r^2}\rho \\
                        \Leftrightarrow ~&\boxed{\dfrac{dP}{dr} = -g\rho}

                        \end{aligned}
                        \end{equation} 
                        This is the <strong>momentum conservation equation.</strong>
                        <br>

                        <strong>Mass conservation equation</strong> can be expresses as:

                        $$\boxed{\dfrac{dM}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho}$$ 

                        Now we have three unknowns (P, M, $\rho$), and two differential equations. 
                        For thiss, we need to have another equation, which is the equation of state P = P ($\rho$, T).
                        Since T is another unknown, we now need to have another equation for $\dfrac{dT}{dr}$ (radiative transfer equation).

                        <br>
                        The pressure in a star is given by the sum of gas pressure and radiation pressure:
                        $$P = P_{gas} + P_{rad}$$ 
                        where $P_{rad} = \dfrac{aT^4}{3}$, "a" here is the radiation density constant.

                        From statistical mechanics, we have that: 
                        $$P_{gas} = \dfrac{1}{3} \sum_i m_i v_i^2 = \dfrac{2}{3}W_i$$
                        where $W_i$ is the kinetic energy density. We also have that the kinetic energy for a monatomic molecule is: 
                        $$E_k = \dfrac{3}{2} K_B T$$ 
                        
                        Therefore, we can express the gas pressure as: 
                        $$P_{gas} = \dfrac{2}{3}~\dfrac{3}{2}~n K_B T = \dfrac{\rho}{\mu m_H} K_B T = \dfrac{K_B T \rho}{\mu m_H}$$
                        where n is the number of particles per unit volume. 
                        
                        Finally, we can express the total pressure as:
                        $$\boxed{P = \dfrac{K_B T \rho}{\mu m_H} + \dfrac{aT^4}{3}}$$
                        
                        <br> 
                        We can introduce another equation, which is the <strong>radiative transfer equation</strong>:
                        $$\boxed{\dfrac{dT}{dr} = -\dfrac{3\kappa\rho}{4act^3}(\phi_rad + \phi_{cond})}$$
                        where $\kappa$ is the opacity, $\phi_{rad}$ is the radiative flux, and $\phi_{cond}$ is the conductive flux.
                        <br>
                        However, from Stefan-Boltzmann law, we have that:
                        $$L = 4\pi r^2 \sigma T^4 = 4\pi r^2 \phi$$ 
                        therefore, we have to introduce another unknown, which is L. To deal with this, we use the <strong>energy conservation equation</strong>:
                        $$\boxed{\dfrac{dL}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho \epsilon}$$
                        where $\epsilon$ is the <strong>energy generation rate per unit time</strong>, $\epsilon = \epsilon_g + \epsilon_N + \epsilon_{\nu}$.

                        <br>
                        Since the time scale for chemical composition to change is much larger, we can neglect it!

                        <br> <br> 
                        
                        Another important point is the radius 'r' is not suitable as an independent variable sicne it's not able to follow the changes of the star. 
                        The mass 'M' is better since it behaves Langragianly. Therefore, we can rewrite the conservation equations in terms of dM by devide both sides by $\dfrac{dM}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho$.

                            In radiative transfer, opacity quantifies the probability that a photon would have an interaction: 
                            $$\boxed{\kappa = \dfrac{1}{\lambda \rho}}$$
                            with $\lambda$ being the mean free path of a photon. In physical terms,<strong> opacity is cross section</strong>. From the radiative transfer equation above, we can see that when <strong>temperature increases</strong>, the <strong>opacity decreases</strong>.
                            <br><br>
                            The total opacity is given by: 
                            $$\boxed{\kappa = \kappa_{radiative} + \kappa_{conductive} + \kappa_{molecule}}$$ 
                            A useful approximation for stellar interiors is the <strong>Kramers' opacity law</strong>: 
                            $$\boxed{\kappa = const \, . \, \rho^{n} T^{-s}}$$

                            The main source of opacity depends on the physical conditions of the stellar interior. At <strong>low temperature</strong> (T < 5000K), the main source is the <strong>formation of molecules and ions</strong>, 
                            such as H<sup>-</sup>, $H_2$, ($TiO$, $VO$) (optical), ($H_2 O$ and CO) (NIR). The most important one is $H^-$ with: 
                            $$\kappa_{H^-} = 10^{-31}\left( \dfrac{Z}{0.02}\right) \rho^{0.5} T^9 $$
                            At <strong>even lower temperature</strong> (T < 2800K), the main source is the <strong>dust grains</strong>. This is the reason why low-mass stars are fully convective 
                            since the high opacity doesn't allow radiation to transport energy efficiently. This all contribute to the <strong>κ<sub>molecule</sub></strong> term.

                                    This is the absorption of a line photon which excites an electron from a lower to a higher energy level within an atom or ion. This is more effective at $T < 10^6 K$

                         In very dense objects, we have electron degeneracy (associated with <strong>κ<sub>conductive</sub> </strong>). It follows: 
                         $$\kappa = const \, . \, \rho^{-2} T^2$$ 
                         This is because all lower momentum quantum states are filled (Pauli blocking), therefore, only electrons near the Fermi surface (which are very few)can participate in conduction. 
                         This leads to the decrease in the interaction with photon, hence the increase in photon mean free path and decrease in opacity. 
                         <br><br>
                         Conductive opaccity takes into account all phenomena <strong>not </strong>related to radiation and molecules. 

                         For the intermediate and high mass stars, we need to introduce another parameters, which is the <strong>Energy generation rate</strong>.

                        
                        <h2>He burning phase for intermediate mass stars</h2> 

                        <h2>Mass required to molecular cloud to form stars (Jeans Mass)</h2>
                            Using viriral theorem, we can derive the minimum mass required for a molecular cloud to collapse and form stars, which is called <strong>Jeans Mass</strong>:
                            $$\boxed{M_J \leq \left( \dfrac{4 \pi \rho}{3} \right)^{-0.5} \left( \dfrac{5 K_B T}{G \mu m_H} \right)^{1.5}}$$
                            
                            We can see that the Jeans mass increase with temperature and decrease with density. Therefore, cold and dense cloud are more likely to form stars. 

                            <br><br>
                            What typically happens during the evolution of the cloud is that when cooling time is much shorter than the free-fall time, $t_{cool} \ll t_{ff}$, 
                            it means that the molecules and dust are very efficient in cooling the cloud, making the temperature barely change during the collapse. 
                            Therefore we can <strong>assume</strong> that the collapse is <strong>isothermal ($T \approx const$)</strong>. This leads to the decrease in $M_J$ as $\rho$ increases while T remains constant.
                            <br><br>
                            If the cloud is inhomogeneous, the denser regions with $M > M_J$ will collapse by themselves with their own local $t_{ff}$ and this is called <strong>fragmentation</strong> and also called <strong>Kolmogorov Cascade</strong>.
                            However, when the substructures reach a <strong>high enough density</strong>, they become <strong>optically thick</strong> and the cooling time increase significantly ($t_{cool} \approx t_{ff}$), the temperature starts to rise, 
                            and the collapse becomes <strong>adiabatic</strong> (The <strong>isothermal assumption no longer holds</strong>).
                            <br><br>
                            In this phase, a sort of nucleus form and this is the first part of the protostar that reaches the hydrostatic equilibrium. This core has free falling gas surrounding it and this envelope absorbed and radiate the energy from the core outwards as infrared radiation.
                            As the temperature increase (by the virial theorem), the radiation of the core (most of the energy caused by the contraction) begins to cause the dissocication of $H_2$, then ionization of H, then ionization of He, etc. until all elements are ionized. 
                            The hydrostatic equilibrium is reached and a completed protostar is formed.
                            
                        <h2>Low mass vs High mass regime in Stars</h2>
                         <h3>How to move from radiative to convective cores</h3>

                            For the radiative diffusion, we need to have a certain <strong>temperature gradient</strong> to transport the energy outwards. This is given by:
                            $$\nabla_{rad} = \left( \dfrac{d\, \log T}{d \,\log P} \right)_{rad}= \dfrac{3}{16 \pi a c G} \dfrac{\kappa l P}{m T^4}$$

                            We can see that the larger the luminosity, the larger the temperature gradient required for radiative diffusion. However, there's an upper limit 
                            to the temperature gradient that can be sustained by radiative diffusion, which is called <strong>adiabatic temperature gradient</strong>:
                            $$\nabla_{ad} = \left( \dfrac{d\, \log T}{d \,\log P} \right)_{ad} = \dfrac{P}{T} \dfrac{E_T}{C_P}$$
                            where $E_T$ is the specific isothermal heat capacity and $C_P$ is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure. They are given by:
                            $$E_T = \dfrac{1}{\rho} \left(  \dfrac{4 \,P_r}{ P_g}  +1\right)\quad \quad C_P = \dfrac{1}{\rho T} \left( \dfrac{N+2}{2} P_g + 20 P_r + \dfrac{16P_r^2}{P_g} \right)$$
                            $P_r$ is the radiation pressure and $P_g$ is the gas pressure. N is the degree of freedom of the particles.

                            <br><br> 
                            We have two regimes:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>$P_g \gg P_r$ (low mass star):</strong>
                                    <br>
                                    In this case, we have: 
                                    $$\nabla_{ad} = \dfrac{2}{N+2}$$ 
                                    with N = 3 for monatomic gas, we have $\nabla_{ad} = 0.4$. For diatomic gas, we have N = 5, therefore, $\nabla_{ad} = 0.29$. For partial ionization, N is large so that $\nabla_{ad} \approx 0 - 0.1$.
                                <li><strong>$P_g  \ll P_r$ (high mass star):</strong> 
                                    <br>
                                    In this case, we have: 
                                    $$\nabla_{ad} = \dfrac{1}{4}$$
                                </li>
                            </ul>   


                            When $\boxed{\nabla_{rad} > \nabla_{ad}}$, radiative diffusion is no longer efficient enough to transport the energy outwards, and convection sets in. This is known as the <strong>Schwarzschild criterion</strong> for convective instability.

                            <br><br>
                            For a <strong>low mass star</strong>, the main energy generation mechanism is the <strong>proton-proton chain</strong>, which has a weak temperature dependence ($\epsilon_{pp} \propto T^4$). Since this temperature gradient is not steep, it gives us <strong>radiative cores</strong> in low mass stars.
                            <br><br>
                            For a <strong>high mass star</strong>, the main energy generation mechanism is the <strong>CNO cycle</strong>, which has a strong temperature dependence ($\epsilon_{CNO} \propto T^{18}$). This leads to a steep temperature gradient, resulting in <strong>convective cores and radiative envelopes</strong> in high mass stars.
                            <br><br>
                            For the <strong>intermediate mass stars</strong>, we don't know where the velocity becomes vanishing after the boundary of the convective region. This is called the <strong>problem of overshooting</strong>, which is the phenomenon where convective motions extend beyond the formal boundary defined by the Schwarzschild criterion.
                            This is one of the mechanism that can increase the size of the helium core during the main sequece phase. 


                        <h2>Physical mechanism along RGB</h2> 
                            <p>Consider a <strong>low to mid mass star ($0.6 - 10 M_{\odot}$)</strong>, when it exhausts hydrogen in its core, it leaves the MS and starts to fuse hydrogen in a shell surrounding the core. The core increase it's mass as the shell produces more helium. Depending on the mass of the helium core, this continues for several 
                            million years to billion years, with the star expanding and cooling at the a similar or slightly lower luminosity compared to its MS phase. This phase is called the <strong>Subgiant phase</strong> before the RGB phase.</p>
                            
                            <p>Depends on the total mass of the star, we have three different scenarios for the helium core:</p>
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>$M_{star} < 1.5 M_{\odot}$:</strong> The He core will become degenerate. The H shell burning rapidly increase the star's luminosity and force it to expand and leave the MS and cross the Hertzsprung gap on a short timescale. Since the He core produces no energy and conducts heat effectively, it become nearly isothermal 
                                    (almost no temperature gradient). Therefore the core is stable and radiative rather than convective (which needs superadiabatic gradient).
                                </li>
                                
                                <li><strong>$1.5 M_{\odot} < M_{star} < 6 M_{\odot}$:</strong> The core will grow until the <strong>Schonberg-Chandrasekhar limit</strong> is reached, which is given by: 
                                $$\boxed{\left(\dfrac{M_{core}}{M_{star}} \right) = 0.379\left(\dfrac{\mu_{env}}{\mu_{core}} \right)^2}$$
                                where $\mu_{env}$ is the mean molecular weight of the envelope and $\mu_{core}$ is the mean molecular weight of the core.
                                <br>
                                This limit is the maximum mass that an isothermal core can have while still being able to support the overlying envelope. When this limit is exceeded, the helium core can no longer grow and will collapse, releasing energy that causes the outer layers of the star to expand significantly. This leads to the star ascending the <strong>Red Giant Branch (RGB)</strong>.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>$M_{star} > 6 M_{\odot}$:</strong> The star leaves the MS and moves directly to the blue supergiant phase without ascending the RGB. This is because the core is massive enough to continue hydrogen burning in a shell without becoming degenerate or reaching the Schonberg-Chandrasekhar limit.</li>
                            </ul>

                            In summary, in any case, the core becomes filled with He and H begins to burn in a shell around it making the star expands and leaves the MS.  
                            <br><br>
                            During the RGB phase, there will be a point where the convective core will start to reside called <strong>first dredge-up</strong>, because the outer layers expand and cool down, making the convective zone move inward. 
                            This is when the material from the bottom of the convective zone is brought to the surface and vice versa. This is the <strong>first time</strong> in the life of the star that the <strong>chemical composition change</strong>.  
                            <br><br>
                            When the RGB phase continues, the first dredge-up leave a discontinuity in the hydrogen profile. The He core will also continues to grow, push the H shell outwards until it reaches the discontinuity. 

                            For stars approaching the tip of the RGB, the He core becomes more degenerate and increase its temperature and starts to loose energy via thermal neutrino emission which make the center cooler and not the hottest point anymore.
                            This process coninues until $M_{core}^{He} \approx 0.5 M_{\odot}$, which is needed for <strong>triple-alpha process</strong> and the star can burn He in the core. 
                            <br><br>
                            In the He core of <strong>low mass stars</strong> (0.6 - 2.0 $M_{\odot}$), the triple-alpha process ignites in a runaway fusion called <strong>Helium Flash</strong> due to the degenerate nature of the core. We know that in degenerate matter, pressure is independent of temperature.
                            Therefore, when He fusion starts, the temperature rises rapidly without the change of pressure (pressure change leads to expansion which cools the core). Temperauture increase leads to more He fusion, causing a <strong>thermal runaway</strong> mentioned above. However, 
                            the energy released in absorbed by the core, lifting the degeneracy and expand the core, therefore it <strong>can't be seen from outside</strong>. Due to the expansion of the core, the H shell expands and cools down, reduce the total energy generation of the star. This makes the star to 
                            contract and move to the <strong>Horizontal Branch (HB)</strong> on the HR diagram, <strong>shrinking in radius and increasing the surface temperature</strong>.

                            <br><br>
                            However, the majority of energy is still come from H fusion in the shell rather than He, and this produce more He to the core. The He at the shell then produce a thermal runaway, which is called <strong>Helium Shell Flash</strong> or <strong>Thermal Pulse</strong>. 
                            This process continues towards the end of the <strong>Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)</strong> phase. 

                            <br><br>
                            During the <strong>AGB phase</strong>, the star has consumed most of its He in the core and make it into a <strong>C-O core</strong>. The H and He shell burning continue, <strong>parralleling with the original RGB</strong> phase but with a faster energy generation rate. 
                            In the early part of this phase, large energy flux produced by <strong>He burning shell expand and cool down the H shell</strong>, make the H burning stop. 
                            This makes the outer convection zone to penetrate deeper into the star (known as the <strong>second dredge-up</strong>), bringing more processed material, <strong>mostly He and N (due to CNO cycle)</strong> to the surface.
                            <br><br>
                            During the later part of the AGB phase, due to the <strong>thermal pulses</strong> from the He shell flashes, the <strong>outer layer expands and contracts periodically</strong>, make the convective zone to penetrate even deeper into the star. This is known as the <strong>third dredge-up</strong>, 
                            which brings up <strong>carbon and s-process elements</strong> produced in the He shell <strong>to the surface</strong>. In leading to the formation of <strong>carbon stars</strong>.
